When you click on the red logo under features, it will take you to a responsive site. On that site, you can enter From (any address in the world or type in a place such as Disneyland) and To (any address in the world or a place such as Las Vegas) and hit Drive. Note: since this project required showcasing front end skills without using the backend (no server), you will have to download a google chrome extension called “Allow-Control-Allow-Origin” by vitvad and enable it after you click on the red logo under features and then type in the From and To address and hit Drive. After that you can hit drive back which will take you back to the initial location of the address. Just like in google maps.
